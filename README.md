# carrkour!

is a 2D platformer game developed in Godot. The premise is simple: you (a carrot) must parkour through the
rabbitlands to get back home, where your vegetable and animal family awaits you. Each level,
you have to collect ten Suns and offer them to the Gate, who will let you progress through
the realms. Following the footsteps of many great platformers, this game is meant to be beaten
through trial, error, and many deaths :)

There are **three endings** in total:

- Normal Ending (beat Adventure Mode)
- Good Ending (beat Adventure Mode deathless)
- Real Ending (beat Hardcore Mode)

The difference between Adventure Mode Deathless & Hardcore Mode lies in the buffed bunny enemies.
I haven't beaten Hardcore Mode because they move 33% faster and I keep dying to Level 4.
